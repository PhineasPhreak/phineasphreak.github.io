<h1>
Internet Bug Bounty Charter
</h1>
<p align="justify">
Our collective safety is only possible when
public security research is allowed to flourish.
Some of the most critical vulnerabilities in the
internet's history have been resolved thanks to efforts
of hackers fueled entirely by curiosity and altruism. We
owe these individuals an enormous debt and believe it is
our duty to do everything in our power to cultivate a safe,
rewarding environment for past, present, and future hackers.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The Internet Bug Bounty (IBB) program was established to
recognize and reward security research that improves critical
Internet infrastructure.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The program is made possible through generous sponsorships
by several organizations who understand the importance of
a safe and secure Internet. The program itself is administered
by an independent panel of security experts from the community.
</p>
<h2>
Panel Structure
</h2>
<p align="justify">
The Panel is responsible for defining the rules of the program,
allocating bounties to where additional security research is
needed most, and mediating any disagreements that might arise.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Any Panelist may propose a change to the structure of the program
or the Panel through a submitted proposal. Unless otherwise specified,
all proposals are decided through a majority vote. Votes must be
registered within three (3) business days of the submission of a proposal.
In the event of a tie, the proposal does not pass.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Additions to the Panel require a nomination from an existing Panelist.
Each Panelist is granted full veto rights over any Panel nomination.
Removals from the Panel are by majority vote.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Panel members agree to disclose in a timely manner, e.g. after
determining the issue's severity, any vulnerabilities that they
uncover in a personal capacity to the organization responsible
for fixing the issue, or resign their position. Panelists do not
undertake employment for organizations that engage in selling
vulnerability technical details that have not also been shared
with the organization responsible for fixing the issue.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The Panel will organize a monthly meeting via conference call.
Panelists will register new agenda topics ahead of time in the
IBB Panel Meeting Minutes document.
</p>
<p align="justify">
To ensure sustainable and successful operation of the Internet
Bug Bounty, all Panel members agree to adhere to a set of minimum
expectations. The set of minimum expectations for each Panel member
is as follows:
<ol>
<li>
Each Panel member must participate in the scoping and bounty
pricing processes defined below.
</li>
<li>
Each Panel member must agree to vote on reward amounts (or no
reward as applicable) on at least 80% of the reports sent to
the IBB.
</li>
<li>
Each Panel member agrees to participate in a monthly meeting.
Panel members must attend at least ten out of twelve meetings
per calendar year.
</li>
</ol>
If a member of the Panel does not meet these expectations and does
not self-nominate to leave the Panel, they become subject to removal
from the Panel by majority vote. The Panel will provide warning to
the inactive member that they will be removed from the Panel unless
they resume expected activity within two weeks.
</p>
<h2>
Finances
</h2>
<p align="justify">
The Internet Bug Bounty program is sponsored by individuals and
organizations who genuinely care about our collective security. Their
contributions directly fund the bounties paid to finders with no portion
going to the Panel or administration: 100% goes to finders. Sponsors do
not have any special access or rights to vulnerability data.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The Internet Bug Bounty is incorporated as a not-for-profit
organization, but is still in the process of applying for federal
tax-exempt status under IRS 501(c)(3). As such, donations to the
IBB are not tax deductible at this time.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The Panel has authority over the acceptance of all funding sources.
</p>
<h2>
Scoping Process
</h2>
<p align="justify">
The Internet Bug Bounty is comprised of individual scopes representing
specific classes of security vulnerabilities. In most cases, this is
either a specific software project (e.g., OpenSSL vulnerabilities) or
a specific class of vulnerabilities (e.g., sandbox escapes). The Panel
has final authority over which individual scopes are included in the program.
</p>
<p align="justify">
For the scopes within the Internet Bug Bounty, the Panel will:
<ol>
<li>
Define the qualifying criteria for security vulnerabilities.
</li>
<li>
Define the bounty payment structure.
</li>
<li>
Determine the bounty eligibility of each vulnerability.
</li>
<li>
 Defer these responsibilities whenever a capable Security
Team is identified as being capable and willing to take over.
</li>
</ol>
The following sections outline in detail the process the Panel
uses to determine what is eligible to be in scope for the Internet
Bounty.
</p>
<h3>
Periodic review
</h3>
<p align="justify">
The Panel will review this process, at a minimum, on an annual
basis to determine if any adjustments need to be made. Adjustments
to this process will require a majority panel vote. In addition to
review of the process itself, the Panel will also, at least annually,
review the criteria used to determine what software should be in scope
(see “Scoping Criteria,” below).
</p>
<h3>
Scoping criteria
</h3>
<p align="justify">
The following criteria and processes will be used to help identify
which software will be considered in scope for the Internet Bug Bounty.
</p>
<h4>
Introducing New Software Into Scope
</h4>
<p align="justify">
Any new software to be introduced into the IBB’s scope must be
nominated by a member of the Panel, and the Panel must agree by majority
vote to put the software into the IBB’s scope. If a vote to introduce
new software into scope fails, the software cannot be nominated again
for a 30 day “cooling period” from the date it was nominated.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Panelists must consider the following guidelines when considering if a software should be in the IBB’s scope.
</p>
<h5>
Widespread Use
</h5>
<p align="justify">
To be in scope for the IBB, the software must be widely used.
This is in order to best focus the IBB’s resources on software
that may have the most widespread impact. “Widely used” is defined
as software that, if affected by a vulnerability, would impact a
significant number of users. For example, widely used software that
supports commonly used technology like encryption, mobile devices,
browsers, web applications, and email could be good candidates.
</p>
<h5>
Mind the Gap
</h5>
<p align="justify">
In order to most efficiently allocate funds, the Panel should
be cognizant of what software is already covered by other efforts,
and how. For example, if another organization rewards for providing
patches to open source projects or funds secure development, the IBB
should not duplicate this effort, but instead serve in a complementary
fashion by rewarding researchers that identify and disclose vulnerabilities
to the maintainers. The IBB should proactively identify software that
has a gap in rewards for vulnerability research; in conjunction with other
criteria, this is a good indicator that the software should be moved into scope.
</p>
<h5>
Active Security Team
</h5>
<p align="justify">
Software must be maintained by an active development or security team capable
of adhering to a documented vulnerability handling and disclosure process. The
software maintainer should also be on board with their software being introduced
into the scope of the IBB; it is the IBB’s responsibility to reach out to and
coordinate with software maintainers to ensure they adhere to proper vulnerability
handling and disclosure processes.
</p>
<h4>
Moving Software out of Scope
</h4>
<p align="justify">
For any software to be moved out of the IBB’s scope, the software already in scope
must be nominated by a member of the Panel for removal, and the panel must agree
by majority vote to remove the software from the IBB’s scope. If a vote to
introduce new software into scope fails, the software cannot be nominated again
for a 30 day “cooling period” from the date it was nominated.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Panelists must consider the following guidelines when considering if a software
should be in the IBB’s scope.
</p>
<h5>
Dwindling Use
</h5>
<p align="justify">
If a software that was in scope is no longer widely used, leaving it in scope
for the IBB may not provide much value. Given that the IBB is a volunteer-driven
effort with limited resources, removing software that is no longer widely used
from scope frees up resources to focus on strategic efforts to improve how the
IBB is structured and run, as well as to spend time on any new software which
is brought into scope.
</p>
<h5>
Dual Coverage
</h5>
<p align="justify">
If paying bounties for vulnerabilities identified in a software in scope for
the IBB begins to be covered by another organization that does so in a fashion
similar to how the IBB would handle it, this may be a good indication that the
software should be removed from scope. To most efficiently allocate the IBB’s
resources and not duplicate work, the IBB should avoid “dual coverage” of
software provided by another organization. In these situations, the IBB should
collaborate with the organization providing dual coverage to determine what
makes the most sense (e.g. should the other organization move the software out
of scope; does the other organization want to work together with the IBB; should
the IBB move the software out of scope; etc.).
</p>
<h3>
Bounty Pricing Process
</h3>
<p align="justify">
The following sections outline in detail the process the IBB uses to determine
bounty pricing for all programs within the IBB.
</p>
<h4>
Periodic review
</h4>
<p align="justify">
The Panel will review this process, at a minimum, on an annual basis to determine
if any adjustments need to be made. Adjustments to the IBB bounty pricing process
will require a majority panel vote. In addition to review of the process itself,
the IBB will also, at least quarterly, review the bounty pricing criteria guidelines
to determine if any changes need to be made in current bounty pricing.
</p>
<h4>
Bounty pricing criteria
</h4>
<p align="justify">
The following criteria and processes will be used to help identify if and how bounty
pricing should be adjusted for software currently in scope of the IBB. This criteria
will also be used to determine bounty pricing for new software as it is introduced
into the scope of the IBB.
</p>
<h5>
Infrequent reports
</h5>
<p align="justify">
If a particular software within the scope of the IBB is not getting much traction in
terms of little to no reports being submitted, this may warrant increasing the bounty
amounts for that software to encourage hackers to focus efforts on it.
</p>
<h5>
Lack of high impact reports
</h5>
<p align="justify">
If there have not been reports of high quality or impact to a particular software,
assuming the program for said software has a tiered reward system, it may make sense
to increase the reward amounts for the higher tiers. For example, the OpenSSL program
has a well-defined, tiered system of rewards based on severity levels issued by the maintainers.
If the OpenSSL program had a noticeable drop in the frequency of Critical reports, that may
warrant increasing the bounty amount for Critical reports.
</p>
<h5>
Frequent low impact reports
</h5>
<p align="justify">
If a program has a tiered reward system and is receiving frequent low impact reports
that are on the border of the lowest tier / being ineligible, it may be worth reducing
the bounty pricing of the lowest tier to help incentivize hackers to refocus efforts on
higher impact issues.
</p>
<h5>
Total available budget
</h5>
<p align="justify">
The IBB is working within the constraints of the IBB’s total available budget, and need
to balance a fair distribution of funds across all in scope projects. When defining bounty
pricing, particularly for new programs introduced into the scope of the IBB, total available
budget must be considered. Inversely, data analysis around bounty payout trends will help
inform the IBB on estimated required budget for fundraising purposes.
